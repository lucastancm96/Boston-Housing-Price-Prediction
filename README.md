# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction
A demonstration of Gradient Boosting algorithm using Boston Housing-Price dataset from Scikit-Learn <br>
Along with that, I will also compare the difference in the performance of Gradient Boosting regressor with Decision Tree and Random Forest regressor. Then, I will show how to visualize the Decision Tree using several Python packages.
